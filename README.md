# Predictive_Control_for_Thermal_comfort
This repository aims to utilize building automation system and model predict control for human thermal comfort in office building.

In this case, we were fortunate to have a real commercial building as a study case in Taiwan.

We designed a Model Predictive Control module for indoor thermal comfort and fan coil units (FCUs) management.
